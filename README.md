Mojo::Redis::PubSub - Message distribution and processing using Redis backend.

# VERSION

# SYNOPSIS
Mojo app which wants to send data and get stream of processed results will look like:

	use Mojo::Redis::Processor;
	use Mojolicious::Lite;

	my $rp = Mojo::Redis::Processor->new({
	    data       => 'Data',
	    trigger    => 'R_25',
	});

	$rp->send();
	my $redis_channel = $rp->on_processed(
	    sub {
	        my ($message, $channel) = @_;
	        print "Got a new result [$message]\n";
	    });

	app->start;

Try it like:

	$ perl -Ilib ws.pl daemon 


Processor daemon code will look like: 

	use Mojo::Redis::Processor;
	use Parallel::ForkManager;

	use constant MAX_WORKERS  => 1;

	$pm = new Parallel::ForkManager(MAX_WORKERS);

	while (1) {
	    my $pid = $pm->start and next;

	    my $rp = Mojo::Redis::Processor->new;

	    $next = $rp->next();
	    if ($next) {
	        print "next job started [$next].\n";

	        $redis_channel = $rp->on_trigger(
	            sub {
	                my $payload = shift;
	                print "processing payload\n";
	                return rand(100);
	            });
	        print "Job done, exiting the child!\n";
	    } else {
	        print "no job found\n";
	        sleep 1;
	    }
	    $pm->finish;
	}

Try it like:

	$ perl -Ilib daemon.pl

Daemon needs to pick a forking method and also handle ide processes and timeouts.
